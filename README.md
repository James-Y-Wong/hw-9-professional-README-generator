  ## Description
  
  My motivation to build this project is to have an simple way to generate a README file easily. Now this project will prompt me to answer a few questions and generate a README file for me. This README is generated using the application.. This project solves the time wasted when trying to copy and paste a template for each project and changing everything specific to my current project.
